# ECRPAnimSelector
AHK script to create an UI for the /anim's used in ECRP. Also allows user to create "Favorites" for quicker access.

This repository includes the following:
1. An Excel file with a sheet used to put every single /anim option in a category, just for the people interested.
2. The AHK script itself.

AHK is required for this anim selector to work! Make sure AHK has been installed and set up.

Standard hotkey to open the menu is set on "F10". This can be changed by the user (May require you to look through AHK documentation for some more unique hotkeys).
"Favorites" are left empty and separated by 2 "comment" lines for easier recognition for some users.
